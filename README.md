# IX package manager

statically build packages, for darwin/linux, with clang

Goals:
* lto
* clang
* full static
* musl on linux
* reproducible builds
* pure builds if possible
* serve as stalix foundation

* first-class support for darwin and linux
* no(almost) binary seeds, only compiler and dash
