# stal/IX

   
This document contains a regularly replenishing list of **stal/IX** and conventional Linux differences.

## Minimalism

> "UNIX is simple and coherent..." - Dennis Ritchie

**stal/IX** is not UNIX or Linux in the usual sense of these terms.

**stal/IX** - an attempt to rethink some fundamentals without touching API and ABI Linux.

One of the **stal/IX** goals - from the very beginning to build the system in such a way that it’s possible to understand how it works,<br>  
and not only use it conveniently.

## No FHS

Overall, the file system will be familiar to those who know Nix/Guix.

## No systemd

**stal/IX** currently uses runit as the most lightweight solution, perhaps, this will change in the future.

## Musl

https://codebrowser.dev/glibc/glibc/nptl/pthread_cancel.c.html#99<br>
https://www.phoronix.com/news/Glibc-2.36-EAC-Problems

Glibc does not fully support static linking. **stal/IX** uses musl for internal needs, and allows to build custom soft with an arbitrary libc on a choice.

## Non-root package management

https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/docs/IX.md

All files on the system are IX user-owned, and all package management is done on his behalf.

Consequence - there is not a single suid binary on the system. Sudo - the thin layer over local ssh daemon, for privilege escalation.

## Fully supervised process tree

Every process different from init has a parent different from init. All processes that fail to meet this requirement are killed by a specially dedicated background process. To manage services used runit, encouraging this behavior.

## Static linking
  
No ld.so!

## Wayland only

https://drewdevault.com/2021/02/02/Anti-Wayland-horseshit.html

X is dying, and to maintain the efficiency of the IX package base running with X means doing work that one day will have to be thrown out.<br>
We don’t have enough resources for that.

## Login shell

No<br>
https://askubuntu.com/questions/866161/setting-path-variable-in-etc-environment-vs-profile

Every user session must start from the login shell, even in ssh daemon.

[Patch for dropbear](https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/bin/dropbear/ix.sh#L7) to launch all processes, including non-interactive ones, with login shell.

## Interaction with upstream

Quite often, upstream is not interested in the ideas inherent in **stal/IX**:

* https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=768215#c16 - glib developers actively hinder static linking with glib
* https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/72 - VTE developers don't care about building with musl and don't answer questions - https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/72#note_1415630
* https://wiki.musl-libc.org/faq.html - musl refuses to add a preprocessor macro to determine if code is built with musl
* https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/6828 - sway doesn't want to patch for fully supervised process tree
* https://github.com/skarnet/execline/issues/9 - we can't use the execline utilities in our startup scripts because their static build is too big
* https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/4540 - tty freeze after sway death, and fix that can't enter upstream - https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/bin/fixtty/main.c
* https://github.com/pg83/dlopen - fake dlopen, for projects that can't live without external plugins
* https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/lib/gtk/4/stock/0.diff - XCURSOR_SIZE support in gtk
* https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/lib/glib/ix/1.diff - support for alternative database of mime types in glib
* https://github.com/pg83/ix/blob/main/pkgs/lib/lunasvg/gdk/io.cpp - custom gdk-pixbuf SVG loader, over lunasvg (instead of rsvg)

Therefore, we have to maintain a set of fixes and adjustments for upstream that will never be merged into upstream.

Project goals are more important than the arrogant behavior of some maintainers!
